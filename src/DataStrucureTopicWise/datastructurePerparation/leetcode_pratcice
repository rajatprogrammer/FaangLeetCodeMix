Given an array of Integers, find and replace next smaller element of each element in the given array in O(n).
Approach : Use Stack.
Steps :
Insert element starting from rear.
If top of the stack is greater than current element keep removing until smaller element is found or stack becomes empty.
if Stack –> Empty answer for current element =-1
else answer for current element= stack.peek();
Insert current element to stack and repeat above 3 lines.Further he asked me
